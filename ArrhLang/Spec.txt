Code must be placed in an array structure
Constants can be defined for indices, using: def XXX = 0;
The main method is always index 666, with built-in constant MAIN.

The result of the last line in a function is the return value.
Local variables are accessed using [here][x]. Local variables are not cleaned up automatically.
Overflowing indices default to 0.
Statements are terminated with newlines (no ; )
Single \t indicates a comment
Comment blocks are toggled with \t\t
When defining a function, { must be inline with argument list. Parameter names can only be one character long.
Inside the function, parameters must be prefixed with $ when accessed.

if statements do not use () or {}. Sections are terminated by double linebreak \n\n
if [here][4] < $a
  [0]($a)
  [1]('checked')
else
  [0]([here][4])
  [1]('also')
  
}

for loops use an externally defined variable and the count will always increment by 1.
for ([here][4] < 10) {
}
